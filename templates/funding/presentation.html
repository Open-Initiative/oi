Projects are funded feature by feature, thus reducing the risk associated with the development, and making sure the funds serve the user needs. Plus, as long as developers add features, they get funded, so projects can last for as many years as they need!</p>" %}
        
        {% trans "<p>We’re really talking about professional development for your software here. Developers are committed to their results and users validate the job when it is done.

        {% trans "<p>Free software has its origins in the 1980s, when some computer users wanted to be able to change the software that run these computers. So they created software w with its source code made available and licensed with a license providing users the freedom to use, study, improve and share the software to anyone and for any purpose. As any developer can contribute to the software, we end up considering that software a common that anyone is welcome to contribute and take advantage of.</p>" %}

        {% trans "<p>When free software was invented, many people started to contribute to these software, understanding the fairness it provides. But today free software appears as a credible model that has proved its efficiency. By reusing what has been done by others, developers can quickly create new applications and contribute to the common good that free software is. Plus they get contributions from a larger community: user feedbacks and bug reports, patches for bugfixes or new features, translations… </p>" %}

Free software developers need to earn money, as everybody else. Today many developers sell services around their software, but these revenues are not directly related to the development work itself.</p><p>Open Funding allows you to contribute by funding the features you would like to see in your free software. And once developers have been paid for their work, it's even easier for them to let it go free!</p>" %}

        <h3 id="A8">{% trans "Why did I think contributing to free software was none of my business?" %}</h3>
        
        {% trans "<p>No idea! Today, software is a foundation of our society. There is no machine running without software. Software is simply a recipe on which we rely for many areas of our activities today. At Open Initiative, we believe that it is everyone's business, and it should not be left to financial interests or some enlightened technicians. Open Funding allows you to participate in the construction of free software -- as well if you are a developer who wants to live of your work, or a user who wants software that finally fits your needs.</p>" %}
