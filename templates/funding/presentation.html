    {% trans "<p>If you have a free software project, propose it on the platform with the list of features and the amount of money needed to develop each of them. You promote the project to the community and then users deposit their contributions according to their interests on the features.</p><p>Once the requested amount is reached, you can start developing. The developer determines the delivery date when the project is finished. Users then have 14 days to confirm reception or request corrections. The developer is paid only after validation by the users.</p><p>This way Open Funding secures the conclusion of the project to the users and the payment to developers once the work is done. Access to the platform is completely free for users and developers. Open Funding’ fees are limited to a 5% commission deducted from the amount paid to the beneficiary when the mission is completed. The payment only happens in case the users validate the project, so that the software is guaranteed to answer to your needs.</p>" %}
