        {% trans "<p>Open Funding is different from usual crowdfunding platforms. Cofunding provides a sustainable business model for free software and enables users to contribute and get their voice heard. It takes a professional approach to an open contribution world, and it makes the software more sustainable by helping professionals to keep working on it.</p>" %}
        
        <h3 id="A2">{% trans "A business model for free software developers! Really?" %}</h3>
        {% trans "<p>Open Funding is the best business model free software developers can have. Projects are funded feature by feature, thus reducing the risk associated with the development, and making sure the funds serve the user needs. Plus as long as developers add features, they get funded, so projects can last for as many years as they need!</p><p>Developers are committed to their results and users validate the job when it is done. We also provide real assistance to developers on their communication. So we’re really talking about professional development for your software.</p>" %}
        
        <h3 id="A3">{% trans "So as a user I can now contribute to my software!" %}</h3>
        {% trans "<p>Yes! It is free software, so you can just make it yours! Give your opinion and fund the features you really need. Open Funding is the right place for you to join the community and make your software even better for your needs!</p>" %}
        
        <h3 id="A4">{% trans "What makes Free software so efficient?" %}</h3>
        {% trans "<p>Free software has its origins in the 1980s, when some computer users wanted to be able to change the software that run these computers. So created software that the users are allowed to modify and redistribute. Many people started to contribute to the software, and it quickly became clear that this system had many advantages. Today free software appears as a credible model that has proved its efficiency. By reusing what has been done by others, developers can quickly create new applications and contribute to the common good that free software is. Plus they get contributions from a larger community: user feedbacks and bug reports, patches for bugfixes or new features, translations…</p>" %}
        
        <h3 id="A5">{% trans "If it is Free software, why should it have a price?" %}</h3>
        {% trans "<p>Well, as Stallman said, it is free as in “free speech”, not as in “free beer”. Free software developers need to earn money, as everybody else. Today many developers sell services around their software, but these revenues are not directly related to the development work itself.</p><p>Open Funding allows you to contribute by funding the features you need to see added to the free software you use. And once the developer has been paid for his work, he can really let it go free!</p>" %}
        
        <h3 id="A6">{% trans "Why did I think contributing to Free software was none of my business?" %}</h3>
        {% trans "<p>No idea! Today, software is a foundation of our society. There is no machine running without software. The software is simply a recipe that makes many areas of our activities run. At Open Initiative, we believe that this is everyone's business, and it should not be left to financial interests or some enlightened technicians. Open Funding allows you to participate in the construction of free software if you are a developer who wants to live of your work or a user who wants software that finally fits your needs.</p>" %}
