        {% trans "<p>Open Funding is the crowdfunding platform for all your free software. Here you can help fund the features of free software projects proposed by developers, by contributing and following their progress.</p><p>Unlike platforms that offer donations to the projects, Open Funding proposes to fund a service delivery. Developers are committed to their results and may get several features funded over time. This provides a new business model for free software developers.</p><p>Whether you're a user or developer this site is for you! Open Funding is the intermediate between those who look for free software solutions and those who have projects to develop and are looking for funding.</p><p>With Open Funding, you can contribute and support free software development. Be part of the projects on the long run and tell us the projects you’d like to see funded!</p>" %}

        <h3>{% trans "Why free software?" %}</h3>
        {% trans "<p>Free software has its origins in the 1980s, when some computer users wanted to be able to change the software that run these computers. So they authorized the users to modify their programs and redistribute them. Many people started to contribute to the software, and it quickly became clear that this system had many advantages.</p><p>Today free software appears as a credible model that has proved its efficiency. By reusing what has been done by others, developers can quickly create new applications and contribute to the common good that free software is. But these developers need to live. Today many developers sell services around their software, but these revenues are not directly related to the development work itself.</p><p>Open Funding allows you to participate in free software development by helping to fund the features you need to see added to the free software you use. Today, software is a foundation of our society. There is no machine running without software. The software is simply a recipe that makes many areas of our activities run.</p><p>At Open Initiative, we believe that this is everyone's business, and it should not be left to financial interests or some enlightened technicians. Open Funding allows you to participate in the construction of free software if you are a developer who wants to live of your work or a user who wants software finally fitting your needs.</p>" %}

Each developer is free to communicate as they wish and transmit the information to users to promote and fund the project. However, we are always available to guide you through this process.</p><p>You can contact us: contact@openinititiative.com</p><h4>I gathered the funds, what now?</h4><p>When a feature reaches the estimated amount, you can start the development. The development time is specified in the description of evolution. At any time, you can communicate with funders on the platform to discuss its progress.</p><p>Once the development is done, you deliver the product. Each developer determines with his funders the best way to deliver the result. The product can be integrated into the next version of the software, but it can also be a fork, be delivered as a patch, etc.</p><p>Users have 14 days to accept or request corrections to the product. If after 14 days there there’s no validation of a funder, the product will be validated automatically and the developer will be paid.
